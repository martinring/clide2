Clide2 (beta)
=====================================

*Clide2* is a cloud-based, language agnostic, collaborative development environment. *Clide* started as a web interface for the [Isabelle](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/) theorem prover but has now been extended to a general collaborative environment for the creation of arbitrary content.

Features
--------

* **Mobile** - The default front end of clide runs in the browser and utilizes state-of-the-art HTML5.

* **Collaborative** - The entire architecture is natively built around collaboration.

* **Extensible** - Clide introduces the concept of *universal collaboration*: the distinction between human and non-human collaborators is dropped.

* **Distributed** - All aspects of the development experience can be provided on different servers. Clide takes care of coordinating all those information and integrating them into a smooth user experience.
