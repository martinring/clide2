Clide2 (beta)
=====================================

*Clide2* is a cloud-based, language agnostic, collaborative development environment. *Clide* started as a web interface for the [Isabelle](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/) theorem prover but has now been extended to a general collaborative environment for the creation of arbitrary content.

Features
--------

* The default front end of clide runs in the browser. This makes it **mobile**. There is an **API** which allows to integrate clide into existing editors or IDEs.

*  clide introduces the concept of **universal collaboration** where the distinction between human and non-human collaborators is dropped and every collaborator has the same capabilities. This results in a very flexible, extensible framework which allows to implement intelligent **assistants**.

* TODO
